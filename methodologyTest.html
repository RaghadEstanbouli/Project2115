          <h2>Squarespace Web Design Tools</h2>
          <p>To build the Event Webpage on the Client’s website on Squarespace, the team utilized Squarespace’s built-in web design tools.
          This included the Page Builder tools where the main webpage was generated using the Index tool and Add Section tool 
          to develop 5 main sections. The Basic Tools such as Text, Button, Image, Spacer, Embed, and Code Block and Integration tool, 
          Instagram, were then used to develop elements within each section. </p>
        
        <img src="images/basictools.png" alt="Squarespace Basic Web Design Tools">
            
        <h2>CSS Customization</h2>
          <p>Next, the team worked to customize the design of the webpage to make things fit and work properly beyond the default Squarespace settings.
          This was done using Custom CSS within the CSS Editor window on various elements such as setting the Web Map 
          dimensions to span the width of the webpage to allow it to be a centre piece of the page, making a pop-up window to open the Web Map for 
          users that may be experiencing technical difficulties, ensuring the size of the Donorbox widget and top banner sit the page properly, 
          have the page display proper responsive design, as well as enhancements to the Buttons, Links.</p>
      
        <img src="images/csseditor3.PNG" alt="CSS Editor Window">
          
        <h2>Visualization</h2>
          <p>The design of the webpage was developed to be user-friendly and intuitive.
          It is designed into 5 clear sections with Donate and Register Button links integrated into each section to allow 
          the user the easy ability to donate or register for the event wherever they are on the page.
          Client branding such as font and colour was used within the design of the webpage along with 
          complimentary colours, which was also used in the design of the web map.
          The webpage was also styled to match the Client’s overall website look and feel so it blends in with 
          the rest of their webpages. Additionally, the webpage was designed to be responsive for all devices and 
          follow web accessibility guidelines.
          </p>
      
        <img src="images/colours3.PNG" alt="Colour Blocks">
      
        <h2>Third-Party Applications</h2>
          <p>Third-party applications were implemented into the Event webpage to build a fully functional digital platform that checked off all the boxes
            that the Client wanted and needed for this fundraising event. This included Donorbox for safe online donation collection, Eventbrite for event registration,  
            and My Virtual Mission for mileage tracking and live tracking of event registrants. </p>
          <p> <b>My Virtual Mission was key to the event now being 100% online as a virtual event instead of in person.</b> Event registrants are emailed a link to join the Ride 4 Freedom 
            mission on My Virtual Mission once they register for the event through Eventbrite where they will then have access to the My Virtual Mission Portal. 
            On there, they can input distance they completed in their own neighbourhood using their rides tracked in Strava, which will then translate to distance on the ride.
            Additionally, the public will be able view live tracking of where registrants are on the route with a public map from My Virtual Mission.
