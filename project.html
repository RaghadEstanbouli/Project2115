						<p>The Liberty Project is a non-profit in Pemba, Mozambique. Mozambique is located on the

							The established non-profit works to raise awareness and support for

						<P>would love to see the pic of smiling women we used in the presentation here</P>
						
				
						<p>The project was brought to the team in response to the Client planning a new fundraising initiative, 
							a bike fundraiser for August 2021 in order to raise funds for the charity and continue to 
							support the women of Pemba, Mozambique. Although The Liberty Project is based out of Pemba, 
							Mozambique, the bike fundraiser is being hosted in Ontario as the Chair of the charity, is 
							based out of Ontario, Canada and is the lead for the fundraising event.</p>

			<h1>PROJECT SUMMARY</h1>

				<div>
					<h2>PROJECT 2115</h2> 
				</div>
				
				<div>
									
						<p>The Liberty Project required an event platform to increase awareness about their fundraising 
							bike-a-thon event to encourage donations and registration, and develop a database for 
							donor and registrant information, all which work towards supporting the non-profit and 
							the affected women in Mozambique. The team at Vanritto developed a two-part solution 
							using open source and existing Client software: (1) an interactive event page integrated 
							into The Liberty Project’s website including a storytelling map of the event bike route, 
							the ability to donate and register to the event, live tracking of participants, and the 
							organization’s social media for live updates and (2) a database system to manage donor 
							and participant information. </p>

					<h2>Need Some Words here...</h2>
						
						<p>Development of a webpage and interactive scrolly storytelling web map and donor database management 
							system for the fundraising event Ride 4 Freedom for The Liberty Project. </p>
					
						<p>The Liberty Project is a non-profit based in Pemba, Mozambique on the southeast coast of Africa. 
							The Liberty Project works to raise awareness and support for the women of Pemba who have been 
							sexually exploited, abused, and culturally oppressed. The organization has recently expanded 
							their fundraising efforts, and initiated a new fundraising campaign in Ontario, Canada with a 
							multi-day 1400-kilometre bike ride in Ontario from Thunder Bay to Peterborough. The Liberty 
							Project required a digital platform for the event in order to increase awareness and engagement 
							for the event, encourage donations and registration, and develop a database for donor and 
							registrant information, all which work towards supporting the non-profit and the affected 
							women in Mozambique.</p>
					
						<p>The team at Vanritto, through Fleming College’s collaborative project program, worked to create an 
							interactive webpage for The Liberty Project’s fundraising event that works to encourage engagement 
							from the public with and help generate donations for their non-profit organization as well as 
							generate a better donor tracking system.</p>
					
					<p>The final product consists of two main components:</p>
					
					<p>1. An event webpage on The Liberty Project’s website displaying an interactive scrolly story Web Map of the 
						fundraising event bike route, providing the ability to donate to and register for the event and organization, 
						view live tracking of the event registrants, and a display of the organization’s social media channels for 
						live updates about the event</p>
					
					<p>2. An Access database system for storing and organizing donor information from the fundraising event.</p>
					
					<p>All products used the most cost-effective solutions available, while remaining user-friendly, attractive, effective, 
						and able to be maintained and reused past the duration of this specific fundraiser.</p>
