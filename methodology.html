				<div>
					<h2>WORKFLOW</h2>
				</div>
			
						<p>As this fundraising event was a pilot project for The Liberty Project and there was no specific webpage set up 
							for the event or database management system for organizing donor information, there was no set methodology in place to follow. 
							The team at Vanritto developed a workflow to develop the event webpage on The Liberty Project’s website for 
							the purpose of increasing engagement with the public about the event and The Liberty Project, 
							providing an ability for the public to donate and register for the event, and to develop a donor 
							database system to allow proper management of donor information for future use. </p>
				
					<img src="images/projectwork3.png" alt="Ride 4 Freedom Project Workflow">
				
					<p> The project was built on the foundation of four academic requirements:</p>
					<!--<p> 1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing</p>
					<p> 2. Database Development & Processing</p>
					<p> 3. Programming & Customization </p>
					<p> 4. Visualization</p>-->

			<h1>DATABASE DEVELOPMENT</h1>
			<div class="content5">
				<div>
					<h2>Creating test data</h2>
						<p>Donorbox and Eventbrite are the third-party web applications used for the event for to allow the public to donate and register for the event.
							The applications collect information related to the donors which are accessed by the Client by downloading as CSV 
							spreadsheet. The Client forwarded empty Donorbox and Eventbrite CSV files as an example to the team to 
							build the database required for the project. The headers from the empty CSV files were loaded into the online data generation 
							site, Mockaroo where the data types for each attribute field were set, allowing us to export unique data for testing and 
							development.</p>
							<img src="images/mockaroo.png" alt="Mockaroo">
												
					<h2>Buisness Rules & Primary Tables</h2>
						<p>The Client required an Access database to enable storage and query of donor and registrant data and tracking, 
							engagement, and advertising. The test data was loaded and four primary tables were developed for the database 
							based on the Client’s business rules: Donations, Donors, Transactions and Event Shirts.</p>
							<img src="images/table_develop.png" alt="Database table Development">
					
					<h2>Establishing the Database Workflow</h2>
						<p>Data modelling helped illustrate the data flow inside the database. This process allowed us to functionally 
							extract additional information and to streamline the development of interactive tools to improve the overall 
							database functionality.</p>
							<img src="images/er_diagram.jpg" alt="Work flow diagram">
					
					<h2>Customization for Maximum Efficiency</h2>
						<p>The Graphic User Interface (GUI) was designed to streamline the functions of the database based on the data transfer extract, transform, load (ETL) workflow.
							The GUI uses custom programmed buttons to run and automate all steps of the ETL for the client. The GUI was designed 
							using forms tools and buttons in the Access database and manipulating their events to run programmed functions using 
							Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).</p>

			<h1>EVENT WEBPAGE</h1>
			<div class="content5">
				
			<div>
					<h2>Squarespace Web Design Tools</h2>
						<p>To build the Event Webpage on the Client’s website on Squarespace, the team utilized Squarespace’s built-in web design tools:
						This included the Page Builder tools where the main webpage was generated using the Index tool and Add Section tool 
						to develop 5 main sections. The Basic Tools such as Text, Button, Image, Spacer, Embed, and Code Block and Integration tool, 
						Instagram, were then used to develop elements within each section </p>
					
					<img src="images/basictools.png" alt="Squarespace Basic Web Design Tools">
							
					<h2>CSS Customization</h2>
						<p>Next, the team worked to customize the design of the webpage to make things fit and work properly beyond the default Squarespace settings:
						This was done using Custom CSS within the CSS Editor window on various elements such as setting the web map 
						dimensions to span the width of the webpage to allow it to be a centre piece of the page, making a pop-up window to open the web map for users 
						experiencing technical difficulties, ensuring the size of the Donorbox widget  and top banner sit the page properly, 
						as well as  enhancements to the Buttons, Links, and responsive design </p>
				
					<img src="images/csseditor.PNG" alt="CSS Editor Window">
						
					<h2>Visualization</h2>
						<p>The design of the webpage was developed to be user-friendly and intuitive.
						It is designed into 5 clear sections with Donate and Register Button Links integrated into each section to allow 
						the user the easy ability to donate or register for the event wherever they are on the page.
						Client branding such as font and colour was used within the design of the webpage along with 
						complimentary colours which was also used in the design of the web map.
						The webpage was also styled to match the Client’s overall website look and feel so it blends in with 
						the rest of their webpages as well have responsive design for all devices and follow web accessibility guidelines.
						</p>
				
					<img src="images/colours.PNG" alt="Colour Blocks">
				
					<h2>Third-Party Applications</h2>
						<p>Third-party applications were implemented into the Event webpage:
							This included Donorbox for safe online donation collection,  
							Eventbrite for event registration,  
							and My Virtual Mission for mileage tracking and live tracking of event registrants.
							Event registrants are emailed a link to My Virtual Mission once they register for the event through Eventbrite
							They will then have access to the Portal where they can input distance they completed neighbourhood 
							which will translate to distance on the ride.
							Additionally, the public will be able view live tracking of where registrants are on the route with a public map from My Virtual Mission

			<h1>STORYTELLING WEB MAP</h1>
			<div class="content5">
				
				<div>
					<h2>Custom Base Map Style</h2>

						<p>The original idea that the team had come up with to solve the Problem Statement 
							was to use Live Tracking where the rider’s live location would be shown on 
							the webpage created for the fundraising event. This would allow the public 
							to see how the riders were progressing on the route during the day and over 
							the course of the multi-day event. During this time, the team was looking at 
							various platforms that would allow them to generate web maps. This included 
							looking at <a href=" https://www.mapbox.com/" target="_blank" class="links">Mapbox</a>, 
							<a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank" class="links">Leaflet</a>, 
							<a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/about/mymaps/" target="_blank" class="links"> Google My Maps</a>, 
							and widgets for social media.</p>

					<img src="images/start.png" alt="Start Icon">
					<img src="images/stop.png" alt="Stop Icon">
					<img src="images/finish.png" alt="Finish Icon">
							
							<p>After looking at options to have Live Tracking and consulting with the Advisor 
							for the project, it was found that integrating live tracking onto a webpage would 
							not be feasible as live tracking needs a designated App. This was found to 
							be outside the scope of this particular project for the Web GIS Development 
							course and for the product that is going to be built for The Liberty Project. 
							Upon finding out this information, the team set off to find alternative 
							solutions to solve the Problem Statement.</p>
					
					
					<h2>Creating Chapters</h2>
						<p>While exploring alternatives to live tracking that would still carry the essence of visually 
							showing where the riders were on the designated course or how the event was progressing 
							over the days to increase public engagement and interest of the event, the team generated 
							multiple solutions that could be used for the event's webpage through Mapbox functionalities.
							One solution uses interactive storytelling and the other uses animated map tracking.   
							The team also found two other notable discoveries - one using Mapbox 
							to animate a point along a route and another through social media widgets.These are discussed 
							in more detail on the <a href="https://hollieegg.github.io/web1/99/vanritto/solutions.html"  target="_blank" class="links">Solutions</a> and 
							<a href="https://hollieegg.github.io/web1/99/vanritto/discoveries.html"  target="_blank" class="links">Discoveries</a> pages. 
							The team set off once again to  research and explore these options and creating customized 
							working versions working concepts of each idea.</p>
