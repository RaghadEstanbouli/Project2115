					<h2>Developing an Engaging Web Solution for The Liberty Project's Bike Fundraiser</h2>
				</div>
			
						<p>This website will guide you through the final group project that was developed by the Vanritto 
							team for the Fleming College course, GEOM99 Web GIS Development. As the team is currently 
							working with the non-profit,  <a href="https://www.the-libertyproject.org/" target=”_blank” class="links">The Liberty Project</a>,
							to develop a webpage on their site to support their new fundraising initiative, 
							OnTheMoveFundraising, a multi-day bike fundraising event, we took the opportunity to explore 
							web map options to develop a web solution that is interactive and engaging for 
							the public. More engagement leads to more donations! To start, the team gathered and generated 
							a problem statement with that would help guide them to find working solutions that will benefit 
							The Liberty Project and their fundraising event. </p>
			</div>
	
		
			<h1>THE PROBLEM STATEMENT</h1>
			<div class="content5">
				
				<div>
					<h2>What is the ideal outcome for this project?</h2>
						
						<p>To have a way for people to be able view where the riders are on the course for a 
							multi-day bike fundraising event to increase engagement for the event as is it occurring.</p>
						
					<h2>What is the current reality?</h2>
						
						<p>There is no way for users to see where the riders are on the 
							event course for the fundraiser event while it is occurring. In addition, 
							there is limited funding from the organization to build a solution to solve
							the current problem.</p>
						
					<h2>What are the consequences if a solution is not created?</h2>
						
						<p>If users cannot view the riders on the course during the event, there may be loss interest 
							while event is occurring which may result in an overall loss of day-of donations and engagement 
							from home. This is a limited time event so the more excitement that is generated on the days 
							that the event is occurring will potentially lead to more donations and as well as 
							knowledge of the organization itself within the general public.</p>
						
					<h2>What is the teams proposal?</h2>
						
						<p>The team will generate a web map that will showcase where the riders 
							are on the course for the multi-day bike fundraiser event, 
							OnTheMoveFundraising, for The Liberty Project.</p>

			<h1>THE JOURNEY TO THE SOLUTION</h1>
			<div class="content5">
				
				<div>
					<h2>The Beginning </h2>

						<p>The original idea that the team had come up with to solve the Problem Statement 
							was to use Live Tracking where the rider’s live location would be shown on 
							the webpage created for the fundraising event. This would allow the public 
							to see how the riders were progressing on the route during the day and over 
							the course of the multi-day event. During this time, the team was looking at 
							various platforms that would allow them to generate web maps. This included 
							looking at <a href=" https://www.mapbox.com/" target="_blank" class="links">Mapbox</a>, 
							<a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank" class="links">Leaflet</a>, 
							<a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/about/mymaps/" target="_blank" class="links"> Google My Maps</a>, 
							and widgets for social media.</p>
							
							<p>After looking at options to have Live Tracking and consulting with the Advisor 
							for the project, it was found that integrating live tracking onto a webpage would 
							not be feasible as live tracking needs a designated App. This was found to 
							be outside the scope of this particular project for the Web GIS Development 
							course and for the product that is going to be built for The Liberty Project. 
							Upon finding out this information, the team set off to find alternative 
							solutions to solve the Problem Statement.</p>
					
					<h2>The Middle Steps</h2>
					
						<p>While exploring alternatives to live tracking that would still carry the essence of visually 
							showing where the riders were on the designated course or how the event was progressing 
							over the days to increase public engagement and interest of the event, the team generated 
							multiple solutions that could be used for the event's webpage through Mapbox functionalities.
							One solution uses interactive storytelling and the other uses animated map tracking.   
							The team also found two other notable discoveries - one using Mapbox 
							to animate a point along a route and another through social media widgets.These are discussed 
							in more detail on the <a href="https://hollieegg.github.io/web1/99/vanritto/solutions.html"  target="_blank" class="links">Solutions</a> and 
							<a href="https://hollieegg.github.io/web1/99/vanritto/discoveries.html"  target="_blank" class="links">Discoveries</a> pages. 
							The team set off once again to  research and explore these options and creating customized 
							working versions working concepts of each idea.</p>
					

					<h2>The End</h2>
					
						<p>Once the solutions and discoveries were fully brought to life as customized working 
							products, the team worked together to build this website to display the results.</p>
