					<h2>WORKFLOW</h2>
				</div>
			
						<p>As this fundraising event was a pilot project for The Liberty Project and there was no specific 
							database management system set up, there was no set methodology in place to follow. The team at
							Vanritto developed a workflow to develop the event webpage on The Liberty Project’s website for 
							the purpose of increasing engagement with the public about the event and The Liberty Project, 
							donate and register for the event, and develop a donor database system to allow proper management 
							of donor information for future use. </p>
				
					<img src="images/projectwork3.png" alt="Ride 4 Freedom Project Workflow">
				
					<p> The project was built on the foundation of four academic requirements:</p>
					<!--<p> 1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing</p>
					<p> 2. Database Development & Processing</p>
					<p> 3. Programming & Customization </p>
					<p> 4. Visualization</p>-->

			<h1>DATABASE DEVELOPMENT</h1>
			<div class="content5">
				<div>
					<h2>Creating test data</h2>
						<p>Donorbox and Evenbright both collect information related to the fundraising activity. Eventbrite collects 
							registrant information, and Donorbox collects donor and donation information, both datasets can be accessed 
							by the Client by downloading as a CSV spreadsheet. The Client forwarded empty Donorbox and Eventbrite CSV 
							files as an example to Vanritto which allowed the team members to build the database required for the project. 
							The headers from the empty CSV files were loaded into the online data generation site, Mockaroo,  the data 
								types for each attribute field were set, allowing us to export unique data for testing and development.</p>
							<img src="images/mockaroo.png" alt="Mockaroo">
												
					<h2>Buisness Rules & Primary Tables</h2>
						<p>The Client required an Access database to enable storage and query of donor and registrant data and tracking, 
							engagement, and advertising. The test data was loaded and four primary tables were developed for the database 
							based on the Client’s business rules: Donations, Donors, Transactions and Event Shirts.</p>

					<h2>Establishing the Database Workflow</h2>
						<p>Data modelling helped illustrate the data flow inside the database. This process allowed us to functionally 
							extract additional information and to streamline the development of interactive tools to improve the overall 
							database functionality.</p>

					<h2>Customization for Maximum Efficiantcy</h2>
						<p>The Graphic User Interface (GUI) was designed to streamline the functions of the database based on the ETL workflow.
							The GUI uses custom programmed buttons to run and automate all steps of the ETL for the client. The GUI was designed 
							using forms tools and buttons in the Access database and manipulating their events to run programmed functions using 
							Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).</p>

			<h1>EVENT WEBPAGE</h1>
			<div class="content5">
				
			<div>
					<h2>The Beginning </h2>

						<p>The original idea that the team had come up with to solve the Problem Statement 
							was to use Live Tracking where the rider’s live location would be shown on 
							the webpage created for the fundraising event. This would allow the public 
							to see how the riders were progressing on the route during the day and over 
							the course of the multi-day event. During this time, the team was looking at 
							various platforms that would allow them to generate web maps. This included 
							looking at <a href=" https://www.mapbox.com/" target="_blank" class="links">Mapbox</a>, 
							<a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank" class="links">Leaflet</a>, 
							<a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/about/mymaps/" target="_blank" class="links"> Google My Maps</a>, 
							and widgets for social media.</p>

					<img src="images/stop.png" alt="Stop Icon">
					<img src="images/finish.png" alt="Finish Icon">
							
							<p>After looking at options to have Live Tracking and consulting with the Advisor 
							for the project, it was found that integrating live tracking onto a webpage would 
							not be feasible as live tracking needs a designated App. This was found to 
							be outside the scope of this particular project for the Web GIS Development 
							course and for the product that is going to be built for The Liberty Project. 
							Upon finding out this information, the team set off to find alternative 
							solutions to solve the Problem Statement.</p>

					<h2>The Middle Steps</h2>
					
						<p>While exploring alternatives to live tracking that would still carry the essence of visually 
							showing where the riders were on the designated course or how the event was progressing 
							over the days to increase public engagement and interest of the event, the team generated 
							multiple solutions that could be used for the event's webpage through Mapbox functionalities.
							One solution uses interactive storytelling and the other uses animated map tracking.   
							The team also found two other notable discoveries - one using Mapbox 
							to animate a point along a route and another through social media widgets.These are discussed 
							in more detail on the <a href="https://hollieegg.github.io/web1/99/vanritto/solutions.html"  target="_blank" class="links">Solutions</a> and 
							<a href="https://hollieegg.github.io/web1/99/vanritto/discoveries.html"  target="_blank" class="links">Discoveries</a> pages. 
							The team set off once again to  research and explore these options and creating customized 
							working versions working concepts of each idea.</p>
					

					<h2>The End</h2>
					
						<p>Once the solutions and discoveries were fully brought to life as customized working 
							products, the team worked together to build this website to display the results.</p>
